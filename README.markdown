# fs - File system utilities for Clojure

This library defines some utilities for working with the file system in Clojure. Mostly, it wants to fill the gap that `clojure.java.io` leaves and add on (and prettify) what `java.io.File` provides.

## Usage

Forthcoming.

## Contributors

This library was originally devised and maintained by Miki Tebeka, but [I](https://github.com/Raynes) took over for him.
